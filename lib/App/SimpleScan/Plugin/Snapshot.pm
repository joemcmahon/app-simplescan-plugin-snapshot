=head1 NAME

App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Snapshot - Allow tests to snapshot results


=head1 VERSION

This document describes App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Snapshot version 0.01


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::SimpleScan;
    my $app = new App::SimpleScan;
    $app->go; # plugin loaded automatically here

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Supports the C<%%snapshot_dir> and C<%%snapshot> pragmas plus the 
C<--snapshot_dir> and C<--snap_all> and C<-snap_errors> options.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 pragmas

Installs the pragmas into C<App::SimpleScan>.

=head2 options

Installs the command line options into C<App::SimpleScan>.

=head2 snapshots_to

Accessor allowing pragmas and command line options to share the
variable containing the current value for this combined option.

=head2 snapshot 

Accessor allowing pragmas and command line options to share the
variable containing the current value for this combined option.

=head2 snap_prefix

Accessor allowing pragmas and command line options to share the
variable containing the current value for this combined option.

=head2 snap_layout

Accessor allowing pragmas and command line options to share the
variable containing the current value for this combined option.

=head2 snapshot_dir_pragma

Actually implements the C<%%snapshot_dir> pragma, stacking the 
necessary code.

=head2 snapshot_pragma

Sets the current snapshotting: 'on' (snapshot everything), or
'error' (only snapshot on errors).

=head2 snap_layout_pragma

Sets the current snapshot format: 'vertical' (framed page,
divided vertically), 'horizontal' (framed page, divided 
horizontally), or 'popup' (page containing the debug
info as an IFRAME, with a link to pop up the original page
in a new window - good for XML, since IE and Firefox don't
render XML properly in a subframe).

=head2 snap_prefix_pragma

Set the current snapshot "prefix" - substituted for the 
directory that the snapshots are stored in when the 
snapshot frame file name is printed. This makes it possible
to do things like transform a filename into a URL so that
you can link to snapshots from a report.

=head2 validate_options

Standard C<App::SimpleScan> callback: validates the command-line
arguments, calling the appropriate pragma methods as necessary.

=head2 filters

Standard C<App::SimpleScan> callback: returns the list of filters
for code that will be stacked by stack_test().

=head2 filter

Implements the snapshotting. Add code after every test
that either snapshots every transaction (snapshot 'on') or
only after an error occurs (snapshot 'error').

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< Invalid snapshot type '%s'; 'error' assume >>

You supplied a snapshot type other than 'on' or 'error'.
The plugin assumes 'error', but chides you about it. You'd
be better off to pick either 'on' or 'error' instead.

=item C<< See snapshot %s >>

A snapshot was taken and is located in the file shown.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=for author to fill in:
    A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
    module, including the names and locations of any configuration
    files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
    that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
    configuration language used.
  
App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Snapshot requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
    including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
    the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

None.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=for author to fill in:
    A list of known problems with the module, together with some
    indication Whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming
    release. Also a list of restrictions on the features the module
    does provide: data types that cannot be handled, performance issues
    and the circumstances in which they may arise, practical
    limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that are not
    (yet) handled, etc.

No bugs have been reported.
